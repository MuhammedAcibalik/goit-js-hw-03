# GoIT JavaScript Homework 3 - Arrays and Functions

## Project Description

This repository contains the code for the third homework assignment of the
JavaScript course at GoIT. The assignment focuses on working with arrays and
functions in JavaScript.

## Tasks

The homework consists of three tasks:

### Task 1: Slug Creator

- Created a `slugify` function that converts a title string into a URL-friendly
  slug
- The function converts all characters to lowercase and replaces spaces with
  hyphens

### Task 2: Array Composition

- Implemented a `makeArray` function that combines two arrays with a maximum
  length constraint
- The function returns a new array with elements from both input arrays, limited
  by the specified maximum length

### Task 3: Filter Array of Numbers

- Created a `filterArray` function that filters numbers greater than a specified
  value
- The function uses a loop to iterate over the array elements and checks each
  value against the filter condition
